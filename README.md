# Research Assistant Code Portfolio

This repository contains examples of reproducible code for **data cleaning**, **econometric analysis**, and **visualization** in **Python, R, and Stata**.  
It was created as part of my application for a Research Assistant position, showcasing my ability to work with survey data, perform regression analysis, and generate clear insights.

## Overview
The examples demonstrate:
- Cleaning raw survey data (handling missing values, recoding variables).
- Running econometric models (logistic regression for HIV seroconversion).
- Producing visualizations for policy-relevant insights.
- Writing reproducible and well-documented code.

## Tools & Languages
- **Python**: pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib  
- **R**: dplyr, ggplot2  
- **Stata**: logit regression, collapse, twoway graph  

## Repository Structure
- `example_python.py` → Data cleaning, logistic regression, and visualization in Python.  
- `example_r.R` → Equivalent example in R using tidyverse tools.  
- `example_stata.do` → Example in Stata with logistic regression and graphs.  
- `README.md` → Documentation for the repository.  

## How to Run
1. Download or clone this repository:
   ```bash
